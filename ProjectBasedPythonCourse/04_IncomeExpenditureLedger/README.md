The objective of this project is mostly to introduce python IO and
conditionals. 
The program also uses the concept of creating own module and using it as
library. 
The project is not complete and there are many options to be added in
structure to make it robust. For example the project doesn't have condition
like clear the file. Also, when there is no input file, it doesn't allow user
to add contents in the first run.
However, many useful features are included like data science application using
pandas is also introduced.
