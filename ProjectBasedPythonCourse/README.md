This is a basic course in python. I prepared this while learning python.
Therefore some of the contents are referenced to source I learned from. As I am working
on it, this content is continuously evolving.  

This content is heavily influenced from:
https://training.talkpython.fm/

Because the projects are intended to help beginners, the projects are simpler
and there is still room for further improvement.

Please feel free to use the contents. It is always a good practice to credit
reference.
